## The Effect of Vitamin C on Tooth Growth in Guinea Pigs  

This Shiny App visualises the effect of different types of vitamin C suppliments on tooth growth in Guinea Pigs.  

The dataset is the "ToothGrowth" R dataset: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/ToothGrowth.html

Two suppliments are tested, each with a 0.5 mg, 1 mg and 2 mg dose per day.   

The  suppliments are Orange Juice (OJ) and Ascorbic Acid (VC).
